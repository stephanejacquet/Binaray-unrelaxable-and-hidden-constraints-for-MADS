This is how to use the different scrpits and functions in order to compare diffents ways to handle binary, unrelaxable and hidden constraints with MADS. This work has been done by Charles AUDET (Polytechnique Montréal), Gilles CAPOROSSI (HEC Montréal) and Stéphane JACQUET (UQAC).

1. The folders currently have all the tests done. If you want to only produce the data profiles, go to step 6.

2. If you want to start from scratch, use the script ''undo'' on STYRENE, MDO and LOCKWOOD. Empty ''Problems90''

3. For STYRENE and MDO, use ''run'' with the correct folder.

4. For LOCKWOOD, use ''runLockwood''.

5. Put all the problems in ''problems90'' and name the problems of STYRENE from 1 to 30, the ones from MDO from 31 to 60 and the ones from LOCKWOOD from 61 to 90.

6. Use DP_PP.m with MATLAB. Choose n, the number of solvers (normally 90) and m=number of solvers (the number of solvers you want to compare). Choose the solvers (versions of MADS) below. Choose the precisions in tau. Beware of the legend in data and performance profiles, they are not updated automatically. This must be done by changing legends in DP_PP.m or manually.
